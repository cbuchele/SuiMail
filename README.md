SuiMail is a decentralized application (DApp) built on the Sui blockchain, designed to revolutionize digital communication and commerce in the Web3 era. By combining a privacy-focused on-chain email system with a customizable NFT marketplace, SuiMail empowers users with secure, private, and decentralized tools for communication and trade.
