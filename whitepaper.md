SuiMail: Decentralized Privacy-Oriented Email and Online Bazaar System
Abstract
SuiMail is an innovative decentralized application (DApp) built on the Sui blockchain, offering a privacy-focused on-chain email system integrated with a customizable NFT marketplace. Leveraging advanced technologies such as the Walrus Protocol for secure data storage and the Sui Name Service (SuiNS) for user-friendly identity management, SuiMail aims to redefine digital communication and commerce in the Web3 era.

Introduction
In the rapidly evolving digital landscape, concerns over data privacy and security have become paramount. Traditional email services often rely on centralized servers, making them susceptible to data breaches and unauthorized access. Simultaneously, the burgeoning NFT market necessitates platforms that allow users to showcase and trade digital assets seamlessly. SuiMail addresses these challenges by providing a decentralized platform that ensures privacy, security, and user autonomy.

Key Features
1. Decentralized On-Chain Email System
Privacy and Security: Utilizing the Walrus Protocol, SuiMail stores encrypted message content in decentralized storage, ensuring that only intended recipients can access the data. References to message content are stored on-chain, providing an additional layer of security and immutability.

SUI NAME SERVICE

2. Customizable NFT Stores
Personalized Profiles: Each user has a unique profile where they can establish a store to showcase and sell up to eight different NFTs.

Seamless Transactions: Buyers can purchase NFTs directly from a user's store. Proceeds from sales are stored in the seller's kiosk tab within their profile, allowing for easy withdrawal and management of funds.

3. Integration with Sui Name Service (SuiNS)
Enhanced Identity Management: By supporting SuiNS, SuiMail enables users to associate their profiles and stores with unique, human-readable names, fostering trust and recognition within the community. 
SUI NAME SERVICE

Streamlined Communication: SuiNS integration ensures that users can effortlessly connect and communicate using easily identifiable addresses, enhancing the overall user experience.

4. Comprehensive Store Directory and Ranking System
Discoverability: A dedicated tab showcases all user stores, allowing visitors to browse and explore various offerings.

Performance Metrics: The platform features a ranking system that highlights top-performing stores based on sales volume and popularity, incentivizing quality and active participation.

5. Future-Proofing with STAMPS Token
Premium Features: The upcoming STAMPS token will unlock advanced functionalities within SuiMail, offering users enhanced capabilities and experiences.

Community Engagement: A planned STAMPS airdrop will reward active users, encouraging continuous interaction and contribution to the platform's growth.

Technical Architecture
1. Data Storage and Security with Walrus Protocol
SuiMail employs the Walrus Protocol to handle large binary files and unstructured data securely. By distributing encrypted message content across a network of decentralized storage nodes, Walrus ensures high availability and fault tolerance. This architecture allows SuiMail to maintain data integrity and confidentiality without relying on centralized servers.

2. Identity and Addressing via Sui Name Service
Integration with SuiNS provides users with the ability to register unique, human-readable domain names (e.g., username.sui). These names replace complex wallet addresses, simplifying transactions and communications. SuiNS operates on the Sui blockchain, ensuring that all name registrations are secure, decentralized, and easily verifiable. 
SUI NAME SERVICE

3. Smart Contract Functionality
SuiMail's operations are governed by smart contracts deployed on the Sui blockchain. These contracts manage various aspects of the platform, including:

Email Transactions: Handling the sending, receiving, and storage of encrypted messages.

NFT Store Management: Overseeing the creation, customization, and operation of user stores, as well as facilitating NFT transactions.

STAMPS Token Integration: Managing the distribution and utility of STAMPS tokens, including access to premium features and airdrop mechanisms.

SuiNS Domain Registration: Users begin by registering a unique .sui domain through SuiNS, establishing their identity on the platform.

Profile Customization: Upon registration, users can personalize their profiles, including setting up their NFT stores and linking their on-chain email addresses.

2. Navigating the Platform
Intuitive Interface: SuiMail offers a user-friendly dashboard that seamlessly integrates email functionalities with NFT store management.

Store Exploration: Visitors can browse the comprehensive store directory, view rankings, and engage with sellers directly through their profiles.

3. Transaction Processes
Secure Communications: Sending and receiving emails involve end-to-end encryption, with message content stored securely via the Walrus Protocol.

Effortless NFT Trading: Purchasing NFTs is straightforward, with funds transferred securely and transparently on-chain.

Future Developments

SuiMail current progress and timeline 


TIMELINE AFTER SPONSORSHIP NFT ALLOCATION IS DONE

10 TIER 1 FOUNDING SPONSOR NFT
100 TIER 2 FOUNDING SPONSOR NFT
1000 TIER 3 FOUNDING SPONSOR NFT
10000 TIER 4 FOUNDING SPONSOR NFT

Founding sponsors will be ranked in Tier by the amount of SUI they sponsorered, and their NFT after the STAMPS launch will be able too A, be staked in our own STAMPS Liquidity pool and earn percentage of the rewards based on the tier of their NFT, or B they can swap their NFT out for STAMPS immediatly after launch ( of course with anti jeet tecnology in place )

FOUNDER SPONSOR NFT HOLDERS WILL EARN A PERCENTAGE OF ALL STORES SALES FEES WHILE STAKED

meaning % of all sales that happened on the platform.

We will open the Sponsorship immediatly

ok so now we need too add the mint sponsor nft function, and the edit sponsor nft function, this is how its going too work

The sponsor will mint an nft at the price minimum of 10 SUI, we will include a variable in the nft that can be editted that will work in the following manner

sponsors that buy our NFT and donate 10 - 1000 SUI, will be located in TIER 4
1000 - 4999 SUI TIER 3
5000 - 49999 SUI TIER 2 
50000 SUI TIER 1

DO NOT PUT MORE THAN 50,000 SUI IN ONE NFT 

THERE WILL ONLY BE 10 TIER 4 NFTS ALLOWED TO BE EDITTED
100 TIER 2
1000 TIER 3
10000 TIER 4

THIS WILL BE A TOTAL OF 40% OF ALL FEES GENERATED ON OUR STORES PLATFORM SPLIT BETWEEN THE OWNERS OF THESE NFTS!!! THE NFTS MUST BE STAKED FOR YOU TOO EARN YOUR %, AND IT WILL BE DISTRIBUTED BETWEEN ALL HOLDERS EVERY 24 HOURS

So we need too mint the NFT originally they will start at TIER 4, and there is a MAX of 10,000 of these that exist at all times. 

then we have the TIER 3 NFTS, since we want users too be able too add sponsorship funds too their nft , too raise the TIER, once the user reaches the determined amount for the next TIER, he should be able too call a function that will update his NFT too the next TIER, and some way for us too make sure that there are only max of 1000 TIER 3 NFTS at a time, and we should follow this until we have TIER 1 NFT, where the user cant put any more than 50,000 SUI

With SuiMail Stores you can turn any moment or image into a collectable

Each user will be able too purchase their own store, and in this store, the user can upload a photo, (jpeg,png,jpg)
And this image will be listed with a SUI price in their store.

If a buyer comes along and decided too buy this image, it will be turned into an NFT and sent too the buyer, and the sellers funds will remain in his store where he can interact with it and withdraw whenever he wants!

Your profile in SuiMail is your way of representing yourself, you will have a username with an @, as well as a display name, and a bio.  Managing your store from your profile tab you will be able too add or delete items too your own store, as well as withdraw the funds your store has gathered.

Each store can have a maximum of 8 items listed at a time.


Mailbox
Our Suimail mail system works with a completely encrypted storage using Walrus ( all of our storage we are proudly using walrus, and this should be a selling point on our site and homepage, all emails, images and storage means being used in our dapp right now is through walrus and sui blockchain.)

We believe that this is the future of true uncensored communication, Our SuiMail service will fully incorporate the use of SuiNS, so if you have a Sui NS, you will be able too use it too send and receive emails on the Suimail platform.

Suimail is completely decentralized useing only decentralized storage through walrus, and indexing storage through SUI, we have no database holding external user data and are 100% decentralized!
